Privacy Policy ("Policy")

_Last updated: December 30, 2024_

Please read this Privacy Policy ("Policy") carefully before using the Google Docs Add-On called **Chords Grid Crafter** (the "Add-On") operated by **Chords Grid Crafter** ("The Developer", "Us", "We", or "Our").

The Add-On needs access to read and write the currently open Google Document in order insert new images or read existing images "alt-description". None of the information it reads or writes is sent to The Developer. All your data is your data and while the Add-On script does read and write the contents of the Google Doc where it is activated by the user, The Developer does not have access to any of that information.

Note that in using Google Docs at all, you are of course subject to [Google's Privacy Policy](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://policies.google.com/privacy&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1614060557631000&usg=AOvVaw2-hLdtFwY3Gv5hwq29QkYt). Furthermore, this Add-On complies with all terms of the [Google API Service User Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy).

The Developer does not have any access to your personal information based on your use of the Add-On, including email addresses of users, or any other personally identifying information about them. The Developer is not interested in your personal information. The Developer made this Google Docs Add-on because they thought it would be a nice tool to have. The Developer is just a code-loving and bass-loving geek with a day job. The Add-On is a hobby from which The Developer derives no income. The Developer hopes you enjoy it!
